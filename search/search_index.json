Workbook aims to be a 1 stop shop to understand the mechanisms and processes commonly used by token projects. It's a living guide that will be a constant work in progress. More ArchWiki than Debian stable . If you like what you see and want to chat with the community who created it you can acquire WORK tokens. The Workbook and chat and token are all part of the Workbench vision. Workbench Vision Technology is empowering if we know how to use it. Ideally it's as easy as riding a bike. Web3 has the potential to change the world , if it's open and accessible . There's a lot of meta-work associated with just getting ready to do the work to create a token project. It doesn't have to be this way. We envision a world where you can go from idea to experimentation in hours rather than weeks or months. Right now this is only possible for the most advanced Web3 engineers. We want to make that possible for everyone. Creating better token projects requires two things: knowledge and effort. WorkBench aims to work both hard and smart. First we're getting the data on the table. Then, we need to do the work to turn data and insights into action. This looks like a library of knowledge ( WorkBook ), help turning that knowledge into token systems ( WorkShop ), and a community to connect and collaborate with ( WORK token holders). As we deploy token projects we will constantly be monitoring them to understand what works, what doesn't, and why. This data driven approach will give us more information to design and build better token projects. Eat, sleep, build, repeat. WorkBook GitHub + MKdocs This Workbook will cover all the basics to design, launch, and grow token projects. It's an a to z, 0 to hero guide for anyone who wants to get into crypto and learn by doing. We want to help you and your community create value together. WorkToken Token bonding curve Anyone can buy or sell WORK tokens via a token bonding curve. What WORK tokens do is up to the community. Anyone can create a mechanism that uses WORK tokens and any WORK token holders can opt in to those mechansisms if they want. There is no centralized authority or official leader. No one controls the bonding curve and no one controls governance. WORK tokens exist, and it's up to the community to make them what they want. WorkShop CollabLand + Discord This is where the community hangs out. You can join the chat by holding WORK tokens. From there you can ask questions, share ideas, and join community calls. If you want, you can also put up bounties for specific things such as applying ideas from the Workbook to your token project.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#the-workbook","text":"","title":"The Workbook"},{"location":"#what-is-the-workbook","text":"Workbook aims to be a 1 stop shop to understand the mechanisms and processes commonly used by token projects.
