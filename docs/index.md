# Welcome to the Workbook!

Workbook aims to be a 1 stop shop to understand the mechanisms and processes commonly used by token projects. It's a living guide that will be a constant work in progress. More [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) than [Debian stable](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/).

If you like what you see and want to chat with the community who created it you can acquire `WORK` tokens. The Workbook and chat and token are all part of the Workbench vision.
