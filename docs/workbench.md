# Workbench

## Workbench Vision

Technology is empowering if we know how to use it. Ideally it's as easy as riding a bike. [Web3 has the potential to change the world](https://medium.com/@cdixon/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e), if it's [open and accessible](https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef). There's a lot of meta-work associated with just getting ready to do the work to create a token project. It doesn't have to be this way.

We envision a world where you can go from idea to experimentation in hours rather than weeks or months. Right now this is only possible for the most advanced Web3 engineers. We want to make that possible for everyone.

Creating better token projects requires two things: knowledge and effort. WorkBench aims to work both hard and smart. First we're getting the data on the table. Then, we need to do the work to turn data and insights into action. This looks like a library of knowledge ([WorkBook](#workbook)), help turning that knowledge into token systems ([WorkShop](#workshop)), and a community to connect and collaborate with ([`WORK` token](#worktoken) holders).

As we deploy token projects we will constantly be monitoring them to understand what works, what doesn't, and why. This data driven approach will give us more information to design and build better token projects. **Eat, sleep, build, repeat.**

## Workbench Components

So that's cute, but how do we make that vision a reality? First, we want to curate knowledge into a format that's useful. Then we want to create a place to hangout and discuss/discover said information. Then we want to create a token that will allow the community to sustainably contribute to the cultivation of said knowledge.

### WorkBook

> GitHub + MKdocs

This Workbook aims to make it easier to design, develop, and maintain token projects. This includes guides on strategies, mechanisms, and tooling. The goal is to help you and your community create value together.

### WorkShop

> CollabLand + Discord

This is where the community hangs out. It's a place to ask questions and share ideas. In the future there will be token permissioned chats and opportunities to put up bounties for things that are important to you.

### WorkToken

> Token bonding curve

`WORK` tokens will help make contributions to the Workbook or Workshop sustainable. Anyone will be able to buy or sell `WORK` tokens via a token bonding curve. From there anyone can use `WORK` tokens to engage with the community. This might look like using mechanisms already available such as token permissioned chats or creating new mechanisms that the community can opt into using if they want. There is no centralized authority or official leader. This is very important. As much as possible we want to minimize governance and make all interactions permissionless and opt-in. It's up to the community to make `WORK` tokens into what they want.
