# Governance

Governance is hard. You've been warned.

This section will talk about why you might need governance (managing shared resources) and the tools you might use to do so (Snapshot, dApps, etc..).

We'll also talk about the difference between global governance and local governance, and when you might want to use one vs the other. For example, allowing decisions about how to organize Discord be managed via Discord polls but decisions on the inflation rate of your token to be managed by token holders directly.
