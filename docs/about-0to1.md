# 0 => 1

This section aims to help you go from 0 (and idea) to 1 (a token). We'll explore why you might want to do so (and why you might not) as well as how to do so. Some parts may be quite technical while others might seem intuitive. You don't need to understand everything here in order to launch your token, but we hope that it's helpful.

If you have any questions, or want to contribute, please submit a PR or join our chat!
