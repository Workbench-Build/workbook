# Creating a Community

Most people create something, then think about how to financialize it. Meme => token. While this makes sense intuitively, in practice it's often hard for communities with a culture of intrinsic motivation to manage external rewards. Much easier if incentives are clear and aligned from day 1. As such we recommend starting with a token from day 1, but it's really up to you.

This section will cover things such as:

- General community best practices
- Discord server organization
- Token permissioned chats
- Giving people a reason to stay engaged
- Recognize and reward community contributors
- Governance and governance minimization

TL;DR: Who wouldn't want to be part of a community that supports it's community.
