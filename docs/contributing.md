## About

The Workbook aims to be a self serve choose your own adventure guide through the wild world of Ethereum. As such, it's going to need to be updated, a lot. We want the content to be easy to find, easy to create, and easy to fork and compose into other things. As such, we'll attempt to break down each thing into a modular component that can then be referenced and updated. Both the Workbook format and the Workbook content are works in progress so if you have a better idea as to how to organize things please let us know!

## Syntax

In the future we might aim to break each section of the workbook into a component so that it's easier to contribute to and update the docs.

### About

1 Paragraph description goes here.

### Resources

- [Resource 1](https://tbd.com) - A single sentence description about the resource.

### Examples

- [Example of the thing live in the wild](https://TBD.com) - A single sentence description about the thing.
- [Another example of the thing live in the wild](https://TBD.com) - A single sentence description about the thing.
```

> Note: Resources should aim to describe the thing in general (class) whereas Examples should describe specific examples of that thing (instance). So for example, if we were describing automatic market makers (AMMs) the Resources would link to things that describe AMMs in general whereas the Examples would be things like Uniswap, Balancer, etc..
