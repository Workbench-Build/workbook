#### 1 Pager

This should describe what you're trying to do, why, and how to implement it. Eventually this will look like a formal specification, but intially it's more of a rough sketch. We'll iteratively update this as we build out and refine the model.

#### Diagramming

A picture says a thousand words!

> Do we have a template for causal loop diagrams?

#### Modeling

cadCAD

Machinations

DIY Python?

Other?

#### Incentivized Testing

xDAI

Mainnet testing token

#### Auditing

Technical:

- Consensys Diligence
- Trail of Bits
- Etc..

Economic:

- BlockScience
- Any others?

#### Production deployment

Ship ship ship

#### Monitoring and analysis

What's the best/easiest way to do this?

#### Governance

How to use said analysis to inform governance decisions.

### Examples

- Ocean V2 is going through the token engineering process to launch V2 of their network.
- 1Hive uses token engineering to design and manage their HNY token and DAO.
- The Token Engineering Commons is designing and deploying their token/DAO using these techniques and tools.
