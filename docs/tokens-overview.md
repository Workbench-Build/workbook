# Creating a Token

Tokens = incentives. If you have [an awesome thing you want to do](start-with-why.md) and want to incentivize people to do that thing, you might want a token. If so, there are many types of tokens. This section will explore the different types of tokens and the different ways you might create them.

## Token Parameters

- Type: fungible (ERC-20), unique (ERC-721), or exotic (ERC-XXX).
- Supply: inflationary vs fixed supply vs continuous issuance.
- Transferability: transferable or non-transferable, that is the question
- Composition: a single or multi-token system (KISS).

## Token Creation

Once you've figured out what type of token you want we'll list a few resources to easily deploy a token of your own.

- Via a Platform: CollabLand, Roll, StakeOnMe, etc..
- As part of an organization: Aragon, Moloch, etc..
- DIY: OpenZeppelin, etc..
