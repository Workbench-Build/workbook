# Creating a Token

Tokens = incentives. If you have [an awesome thing you want to do](start-with-why.md) and want to incentivize people to do that thing, you might want a token. If so, there are many types of tokens. This section will explore a few of them as well as their characteristics.

- Supply: inflationary vs fixed supply vs continuous issuance.
- Type: transferable, non-transferable, unique or fungible.
- Composition: a single or multi-token system.

Once you've figured out what type of token you want we'll list a few resources to easily deploy a token of your own.

- DIY: OpenZeppelin, etc..
- Via a Platform: CollabLand, Roll, StakeOnMe, etc..
- As part of a larger organization: Aragon, Moloch, etc..
